# FedEx_EDA_Project

This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focuses on FedEx's SCMS Delivery History Dataset, which includes thousands of global shipment records for critical medical supplies. The goal was to uncover patterns, inefficiencies, and opportunities within the supply chain to help reduce costs, improve delivery timelines, and enhance vendor performance.

The project began with thorough data cleaning and wrangling, followed by a structured UBM (Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate) analysis. Key findings revealed that:

Air Charter shipments are heavily overused, leading to higher costs,

Delivery delays are often vendor-dependent, not just mode-dependent,

Some low-weight items incur unexpectedly high freight costs, pointing to inefficient shipment planning.

Multiple visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly were used to derive insights. As a result, the project provides data-driven recommendations such as using cost-effective shipment modes, auditing vendor performance, and improving data entry systems.

This EDA lays the groundwork for smarter logistics strategies and can support future models for cost prediction, delivery forecasting, and vendor optimization.
